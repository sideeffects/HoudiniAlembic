"""Loads the geometry from an Alembic scene archive (`.abc`) file into a geometry network."""

@parameters

Reload Geometry:
        #id: reload

        Clears the Alembic cache and reloads fresh geometry.

File name:
        #id: fileName
        
        Path to the Alembic archive (`.abc`) file.

Frame:
        #id: frame
        
        The _Alembic_ frame at which to sample the geometry. The default value is
        `$F` (Houdini's current frame). If you need to offset the start time of the
        animation in the archive, you can add or subtract frames (e.g. `$F + 48`).

Frames per second:
        #id: fps
        
        Combined with the __Frame__ parameter, this is used to convert Alembic's
        time-based animation to Houdini frames. The default is `$FPS` (Houdini's
        current frames-per-second setting). If the archive file was created with a
        different FPS, you will need to enter it here.

Missing File:
	What should be done if the specified file does not exist on disk.
	By default, if there's a missing or invalid Alembic archive,
	the SOP will error.  This can be troublesome in a network that can
	recover from the error.  In these cases the behavior can be set to No
	Geometry so only a warning is posted.

== Geometry ==
Load As:
        #id: loadmode
        
        How the Alembic geometry should be loaded into Houdini.
        
        Alembic Delayed Load Primitives:
                These custom primitives are very light-weight and will display
                faster in the viewport.  They are not as full featured as other
                Houdini primitive types (i.e. ray-tracing is not very accurate),
                but can be converted to other primitive types if need be.
        Load Houdini Geometry:
                Convert the Alembic primitives to use native Houdini geometry.
        Houdini Point Cloud:
                Load the `P` attribute from the Alembic primitives as a Houdini
                point cloud.  Currently, this doesn't load any attributes other
                than `P`.
        Bounding Boxes:
                Load only the bounding boxes of the Alembic primitives.

Display As:
        #id: viewportlod
        
        How the Alembic geometry is displayed in the viewport.
        
        Full Geometry:
		    The Alembic geometry is fully displayed.
		
	Point Cloud:
	    Only the points are displayed.
	
	Bounding Box:
	    Only the geometry bounding boxes are displayed.
	
	Centroid:
	    Only the geometry centroid is displayed.
	    
	Hidden:
	    No geometry is displayed.

Points:
        #id: pointmode
        When loading Alembic Delayed Load primitives, you can create an unique point for each primitive, or all the Alembic primitives can share a single point.  The unique points can all be at the origin, or alternatively, located at the primitive's centroid.

Create Primitives For:
        #id: abcxform
        When loading Alembic primitives, create separate primitives for:

	Shape Nodes Only:
		Geometry in the Alembic scene only.
	Shapes and Transforms:
		Geometry and transforms in the Alembic scene.
	Transform Nodes Only:
		Transforms in the Alembic scene only.

Poly Soup Primitives:
    #id: polysoup

	When loading Houdini geometry, this option determines whether Alembic Polygon Meshes will be converted to Houdini Poly Soup primitives.  Houdini Poly Soup primitives use less resources to store and render.  At the current time Poly Soups cannot be rendered as subdivision surfaces by Mantra.

	No Poly Soup Primitives:
		No polygon soup primitives will be created.  Each face in a mesh will have a unique Houdini polygon primitive.
	Use Poly Soups For Polygon Meshes:
		Create polygon soup primitives for Alembic Polygon Meshes where possible.  This will currently not be done if there are uniform attributes on the mesh or if there are face sets.
	Use Poly Soups Wherever Possible:
		Create Poly Soup primitives for both Alembic Polygon Meshes and Alembic Subdivision Surface primitives.  If there are uniform attributes (per-face attributes) these will be lost.

Transform Geometry To World Space:
        #id: includeXform
        
        Bake each object's world space transformation (relative to the root of the
        archive) into the primitives of the object.

Use Visibility:
        #id: usevisibility
        
	Use the visibility settings defined in the Alembic file to determine
	whether to load geometry.  When loading Alembic Delayed Load
	primitives, hidden primitives will still be loaded, but will not create
	any visible geometry.  There may be additional cost to using visibility
	with Alembic Delayed Load primitives.

Primitive Groups:
        #id: groupnames
        
        Whether to create group names on the Alembic shape nodes, or whether to use
        the transform (object) name. If a transform object has multiple shape
        nodes, it's sometimes useful to put the geometry into the same group.

Subdivision Group:
        #id: subdgroup
        
        When loading Houdini geometry, all subdivision shape nodes in the Alembic file will be added to this group.

== Selection ==

Object Path:
        #id: objectPath

	A path to one or more objects inside the archive. If specified, the
	node will load only these object and their children. The default is
	blank, which means load all the geometry in the archive.

Object Exclude:
        #id: objectExclude

	A path to one or more objects inside the archive. If specified, the
	node will skip loading these objects and their children. These
	exclusions override the objects specified in the Object Path. The
	default is blank, which means don't exclude any objects.

Object Pattern:
        #id: objectPattern
        
        Only objects matching this pattern will be loaded. This is a more generic
        and likely simpler way of specifying objects to be loaded than the __Object
        Path__.

Animating Objects:
        #id: animationfilter
        
        This allows you to filter objects based on whether they are animated or not.
        
        Include All Primitives (default):
                Load primitives whether they are animating or static.
        Only Static Primitives:
                Only load primitives which are *not* animated.
        Only Deforming Primitives:
                Only load primitives with point positions that change over time.
        Only Transforming Primitives:
                Only load primitives with parent transformation nodes that change over time.
        Only Deforming or Transforming Primitives:
                Only load primitives which are animated.

Load Polygons:
        #id : polygonFilter

        This allows loading of polygons.

Load Curves:
        #id : curveFilter

        This allows loading of curves.

Load NURBS:
        #id : NURBSFilter

        This allows loading of NURBS.

Load Points:
        #id : pointsFilter

        This allows loading of points.

Load Subdivision Surfaces:
        #id : subdFilter

        This allows loading of subdivision surfaces.

Load Maya Locater:
        #id: loadLocator
        
        Test for transform nodes which match how Maya saves out locater nodes and
        load these into Houdini.

Box Culling:
        #id: boxcull
        
        This allows you to only load primitives based on their bounding box in space.
        
        No spatial filtering (default):
                Loads all primitives.
        Load Objects Entirely Inside Box:
                Loads only objects which are entirely contained inside the specified bounding box.
        Load Objects Partially Inside Box:
                Loads only objects whose bounding box intersects the specified bounding
        box.
        Load Objects Entirely Outside Box:
                Loads only objects which are entirely outside the specified bounding box.
        Load Objects Partially Outside Box:
                Loads only objects whose bounding box is not entirely contained in the specified bounding box.

Use First Input To Specify Box:
        #id: boxsource
        
        Use the input to the Alembic SOP to specify the bounding box used for Box
        Culling.

Box Size:
        #id: boxsize
        Manually specify the size of the culling bounding box.

Box Center:
        #id: boxcenter
        Manually specify the center of the culling bounding box


== Attributes ==

Point Attributes:
        #id: pointAttributes
        Only point attributes matching the given pattern will be loaded.

Vertex Attributes:
        #id: vertexAttributes
        Only vertex attributes matching the given pattern will be loaded.

Primitive Attributes:
        #id: primitiveAttributes
        Only primitive attributes matching the given pattern will be loaded.

Detail Attributes:
        #id: detailAttributes
        Only detail attributes matching the given pattern will be loaded.

Faceset Attributes:
        #id: facesetAttributes
        Only faceset attributes matching the given pattern will be loaded.

NOTE:
        All intrinsic attributes on Alembic nodes will be created in all cases. For
        example, the `velocity` attribute on points will be created regardless of
        whether it matches the __Point Attribute__ pattern.

User Properties:
            #id: loadUserProps
    	
        How Alembic user properties should be handled.
        
        Do Not Load:
    		User properties are not loaded.
    	
	Load Values Only:
		User property values are loaded as a JSON dictionary into a
		primitive string attribute.
	
	Load Values and Metadata:
		User property values are loaded as a JSON dictionary into a
		primitive string attribute. User property metadata, useful for
		interpreting and processing the values, is loaded as a JSON
		dictionary into a separate primitive string attribute.

Add Path Attribute:
        #id: addpath
        
        This option allows you to put the full path of the shape node into the
        named string attribute, since Houdini can mangle the group names (no
        special characters are allowed in group names).

Path Attribute:
        #id: pathattrib
        
        The name of the Path Attribute.

Add Filename Attribute:
        #id: addfile
        
        Add a detail attribute containing the filename.

Filename Attribute:
        #id: fileattrib
        
        The name of the Filename Attribute.

Remap attributes:
        #id: remapAttributes
        
        Use this multiparm to rename Alembic point, vertex, and/or primitive
        attributes to their Houdini equivalents. For example, remapping `MyColor`
        to `Cd` (diffuse color). Click the + button to add a new mapping.
