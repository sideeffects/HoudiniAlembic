"""Loads the objects from an Alembic scene archive (`.abc`) file into the object level."""

@parameters

Build or update hierarchy:
    Click to read the archive file in __File name__ and build a hierarchy of Houdini objects from the objects in the archive.

Build Hierarchy Using Subnetworks:
    The Alembic Archive will import the alembic objects either using subnetworks (i.e. children contained in a subnet), or by wiring the nodes in a hierarchy (i.e. a single network).

Build Hierarchy With Channel References:
    When building Houdini objects, create channel references to the root Alembic archive. This means that any changes you make to the Alembic Archive's parameters will be picked up automatically by children. However, there will be potentially thousands of channel evaluations.

    With no channel references, you can propagate parameter changes on the Alembic archive to the child objects using __Push Parameters To Children__.
    
Load Hierarchy As One Single Geometry:
    Instead of creating Houdini objects for each Alembic transform and shape, this will load the Alembic archive into a single geometry node. 
    
    NOTE:
        This will still create Houdini objects for Alembic cameras.
    
Flatten Visibility Evaluation:
    In Houdini, when a subnetwork's display is turned off, all its children will also not be displayed. Alembic allows children of a network to be displayed, even when the parent is not displayed.

    Flattening visibility forces each object to determine its own visibility rather than relying on parents. This is slightly more costly, but will reproduce Alembic's visibility model.

Push Parameters to Children:
    Propagate changes to parameters to the child objects (see __Build Hierarchy With Channel References__).

Reload Geometry:
	Clear the Alembic cache and reload fresh geometry for all the shapes without rebuilding or updating the archive hierarchy. 
	
	TIP:
	    Compared to __Build or Update Hierarchy__, this is the faster way to update an Alembic archive version when there is no hierarchy change.
